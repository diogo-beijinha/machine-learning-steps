# Data Preprocessing

Data has to be in a specific format before you can apply machine learning algorithms to them. This is usually known as data preprocessing. Depending on the dataset, there are several preprocessing steps that are required to be performed to convert data into a format usable by machine learning algorithm. Following are the steps involved in preprocessing data for machine learning algorithms: 
 
### Getting the dataset
Pretty self-explanatory. Just download the dataset necessary for the Machine Learning.

### Import libraries
- numpy - The numpy library is used performs variety of advanced mathematical functions. Since machine learning algorithms make heavy use of mathematics, it is highly recommended that you install the numpy library. 

- matplotlib.pyplot - This library is used to plot beautiful charts. To get intuition about our data and results, we will need to this library.

- pandas - The pandas library is used to easily import and view the datasets.

### Import the dataset 
To import the dataset, simply use:
`df = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)`
### Handling missing values 
### Handling categorical data 
### Dividing data into training and tests sets 
### Scaling the data
